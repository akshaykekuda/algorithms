# Implementation of quick sort using 3 types of pivot:
Quick sort is a divide and conquer alorithm to sort a n length.

Pivot used in quick sort can be of many types. This implementation explores 3 types of pivots:
1. First element of array used as pivot
2. Last element of array used as pivot
3. Median of the array used as pivot

Choice of pivot affects the performance of the algorithm and can be veerified by the comp_count parameter, which counts the number of comaprisons made
when a recursive subroutine is called.
