# Algorithms

Here I am implementing some of the algorithms for optimizing various tasks

1. Karatsuba Fast Multiplication Algortihm using Divide and Conquer
2. Merge Sort using Divide and Conquer
3. Counting the number of inversions in an array
4. Quick Sort using Divide and Conquer
5. Karger's min-cut algorithm to find the number of minicum cuts of a graph
6. Randomized & Deterministic Selection algorithm to find the i-th order statistic of an array
7. Kosaraju's Two Pass DFS algorithm to find the Strongly connected components of a graph
8. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
